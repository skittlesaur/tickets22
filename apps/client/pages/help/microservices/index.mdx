# Microservices

Microservices are a software architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled
services. Each service runs a specific task and communicates with other services through well-defined APIs.

## Microservices in Tickets22

Our application makes use of the following microservices:

- [Shop](/help/microservices/shop): Keeps track of the matches and provides APIs to communicate with the frontend.
- [Shop Consumer](/help/microservices/shop-consumer): Keeps track of match updates, and sold tickets with other consumers.
- [Reservations](/help/microservices/reservations): Keeps track of the availability of tickets and manages orders.
- [Analytics](/help/microservices/analytics): Provides analytics about the tickets sold, and user specific data.
- [Payment](/help/microservices/payments): Processes payments and handles billing.
- [Security](/help/microservices/security): Handles authentication and authorization.

Each of these services communicates with the other services through APIs, ensuring that they can work together to
provide a seamless user experience.

## Deployment

Microservices are typically deployed independently, with each service being responsible for its own deployment.
This allows for more flexibility in the development process and enables faster release cycles.

In our application, we use a mono-repo to manage the codebase. This allows us to make changes to multiple services
at once, and deploy them together. We use [TurboRepo](https://turborepo.com) to build and deploy the services.
